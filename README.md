Projects I've worked on that are **public**

My HoloLens video is private to protect from plagiarism, will probably make public again in the future, but you can watch on my YouTube for a demonstration

Two of my latest Mixed Reality projects:
- Augmented Reality Supermarket Experience
- Augmented Reality App for the London National Gallery
